# Passing Thoughts
>This project uses REACT JS to build a React web application called Passing Thoughts. Specifically, we use knowledge of React function components, state hooks, and effect hooks to build this webapp that allows users to add a short thought, which disappears after just 15 seconds.

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
